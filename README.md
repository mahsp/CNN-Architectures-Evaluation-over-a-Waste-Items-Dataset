# CNN Architectures Evaluation over a Waste Items Dataset
 - This is a vision project for classifying garbage into recycling categories by performing a comparative analysis by using different CNN structures; AlexNet, VGG16, Inception v3, and Resnet. This problem involves receiving images of a single object and classifying it into one type from our 6 defined recycling material types using a dataset that contains 400-500 images for each class. In order to enlarge the data set and also improve the accuracy, data augmentation techniques including random rotation and cropping the image are used. Also, that the data set includes images of dirty, ruffled, and crumpled objects to make the model more generalized.
